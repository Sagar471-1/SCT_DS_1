 Air Pollution Visualization in India (2015â€“2017)

This project analyzes and visualizes state-wise air pollution levels in India using publicly available pollution datasets.

## ðŸ“Š What This Project Does

- Loads and cleans city-level pollution data (2015â€“2017)
- Aggregates data state-wise for SO2, NO2, PM10, and PM2.5
- Visualizes average pollutant levels on:
  - A **heatmap over India's state map**
  - A **bar graph of pollutant concentrations**
- Fills missing states with **national average** to maintain full geographic coverage
